## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Idle armed entity auto-acquires nearest enemy already in weapon range
While an entity has a `GuardComponent`, no active `CombatComponent` engagement (entity target **or** ground engagement — `is_engaged()`, not merely a non-null `get_target()`), no in-progress movement, and power online (or no PowerComponent), the guard SHALL periodically scan for hostile entities within the longest weapon's range and, on finding at least one, call `CombatComponent.set_target()` with `hold_ground = true` on the nearest hostile. Acquisition range SHALL be `max(weapon.attack_range) * CellUtil.CELL_SIZE` world units over all of the entity's weapons, measured on the horizontal (XZ) plane. Candidate distance SHALL be measured to the candidate's effective target point: for a candidate with a `FoundationComponent`, the nearest point on its foundation footprint (the same measurement `CombatComponent` uses for range); otherwise the candidate's `global_position`. Hostility SHALL be `PlayerManager.is_enemy(self_player_id, candidate_player_id)` with both ids >= 0. A candidate SHALL additionally be visible to the scanning entity's **owning** player: `ShroudSystem.is_visible(owning_player_id, candidate_cell)` (which includes allied union). The owning player id SHALL be read from the scanning entity's `StatsComponent`, never the local player, so a computer-owned unit is not blinded by the human player's own fog. The scan SHALL query `SpatialHash` cells within a square hood of Chebyshev radius `max(1, ceil(range_world / CellUtil.CELL_SIZE)) + BUILDING_HOOD_MARGIN_CELLS` cells centered on the entity (full ±r index square, not a cell-index circle — diagonal in-range entities must not be skipped), not a full `all_entries()` walk. `BUILDING_HOOD_MARGIN_CELLS` is a bounded constant of 4 covering the widest foundation in content (6x6, half-extent 3 cells) plus one cell of rounding slack, because `SpatialHash` indexes each entity at its centre cell: without the margin a building whose centre is outside weapon range but whose nearest footprint edge is inside it would never be scanned. Candidates SHALL be filtered to entities that have a HealthComponent.

Acquisition is the only place visibility is tested. Once acquired, an engagement SHALL be retained even when the target later moves into a cell that is no longer visible — there is no visibility drop gate.

#### Scenario: Enemy already inside weapon range is acquired
- **WHEN** an armed idle unit with GuardComponent has an enemy whose horizontal distance is <= longest weapon range, whose cell is visible to the owning player, and no active attack target
- **THEN** GuardComponent SHALL call `CombatComponent.set_target()` with `hold_ground = true` and the unit SHALL fire without issuing a chase move

#### Scenario: Enemy in a non-visible cell is not acquired
- **WHEN** an armed idle unit with GuardComponent has a hostile entity within weapon range whose cell is not visible to the owning player
- **THEN** GuardComponent SHALL NOT acquire that entity and the unit SHALL remain idle

#### Scenario: Engaged target that leaves visibility is retained
- **WHEN** a guard-acquired target moves from a visible cell into a cell that is no longer visible to the owning player while the engagement is active
- **THEN** GuardComponent SHALL retain the engagement and the unit SHALL continue firing at it

#### Scenario: Computer-owned guard uses its own visibility
- **WHEN** a computer-owned armed unit scans for a target while the local player's fog is revealed
- **THEN** candidate visibility SHALL be evaluated against the computer-owned entity's own player, not the local player

#### Scenario: Building edge in range is acquired while center is out of range
- **WHEN** an armed idle unit has a hostile building whose foundation-footprint center is beyond the longest weapon range but whose nearest footprint point is within it and visible to the owning player
- **THEN** GuardComponent SHALL acquire that building, consistent with `CombatComponent` range checking

#### Scenario: Building acquired diagonally by its nearest corner
- **WHEN** a hostile building sits diagonally from the unit such that its footprint center is out of range but its nearest corner is within range and visible to the owning player
- **THEN** GuardComponent SHALL acquire the building (the widened hood covers the centre cell and the distance filter uses the corner)

#### Scenario: Enemy in sight but outside weapon range is ignored
- **WHEN** an enemy is farther than the longest weapon range (even if within `StatsComponent.sight`)
- **THEN** GuardComponent SHALL NOT acquire that enemy for this mode

#### Scenario: Nearest of multiple in-range enemies is chosen
- **WHEN** two or more hostile entities are within weapon range of an idle guarded unit and visible to the owning player
- **THEN** the candidate with the smallest horizontal distance to the unit SHALL be selected (ties: first found in deterministic cell scan order), where a building candidate's distance is to its nearest footprint point

#### Scenario: No enemy in weapon range stays idle
- **WHEN** a guarded unit scans and finds no hostile entity within weapon range
- **THEN** GuardComponent SHALL NOT call `set_target` and the unit SHALL remain idle

#### Scenario: Friendly or neutral entities are ignored
- **WHEN** entities within weapon range belong to the same team as the guard (or player_id < 0)
- **THEN** they SHALL NOT be selected as acquisition targets

#### Scenario: Diagonal corner cell within weapon range is acquired
- **WHEN** an enemy sits in a cell whose index offset from the unit fails a cell-index circle of radius `r_cells` (e.g. offset (4,4) with r_cells=5) but its horizontal world distance is still <= weapon range and its cell is visible to the owning player
- **THEN** GuardComponent SHALL still acquire that enemy (square hood, exact world distance)

#### Scenario: Candidate without HealthComponent is ignored
- **WHEN** a hostile entity within weapon range has no HealthComponent sibling
- **THEN** GuardComponent SHALL NOT select it as an acquisition target

#### Scenario: Guard does not steal a ground engagement
- **WHEN** an armed idle unit has an active ground engagement (`is_engaged()` true, `get_target()` null) and a hostile entity enters weapon range and visibility
- **THEN** GuardComponent SHALL NOT call `set_target` and the ground engagement SHALL continue uninterrupted
