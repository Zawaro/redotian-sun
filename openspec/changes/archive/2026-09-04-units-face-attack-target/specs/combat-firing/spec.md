## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Range checking
CombatComponent SHALL check if the target is within firing range before firing. Range SHALL be calculated as `weapon.attack_range * CellUtil.CELL_SIZE` world units, measured on the horizontal (XZ) plane — the Y (altitude) component SHALL be ignored so hovering or elevated attackers are not pushed out of range by vertical separation. For mobile turretless units, being in range additionally requires body alignment per the `combat-facing` capability: in-range but not facing holds fire for that tick while the body slews toward the target.

#### Scenario: Target in range
- **WHEN** the target's horizontal distance (ignoring Y) is less than or equal to `attack_range * CELL_SIZE`
- **THEN** CombatComponent MAY fire (subject to cooldown and, for mobile turretless units, facing alignment)

#### Scenario: Target out of range
- **WHEN** the target's horizontal distance (ignoring Y) exceeds `attack_range * CELL_SIZE`
- **THEN** CombatComponent SHALL issue a move command toward the target position instead of firing

#### Scenario: Vertical separation ignored
- **WHEN** a unit hovers or flies at `4.08` world units above a target that is within `attack_range * CELL_SIZE` horizontally
- **THEN** CombatComponent SHALL treat the target as in range and fire

#### Scenario: Airborne attacker engages ground target
- **WHEN** a jumpjet hovering at its flight altitude attacks a ground target within horizontal range
- **THEN** the target is in range regardless of the altitude difference

#### Scenario: In range but not facing holds fire
- **WHEN** a turretless Track vehicle has an in-range target outside its facing tolerance with no live move leg
- **THEN** CombatComponent SHALL NOT fire that tick and the body yaws toward the target instead
