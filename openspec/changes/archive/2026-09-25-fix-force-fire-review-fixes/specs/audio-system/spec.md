## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Warhead impact sounds

On every damaging hit, the system SHALL play the victim's warhead impact report, read from `WarheadData.sound_impact` (a comma-separated list of audio ids), at the victim's position through `AudioManager.play_random`. The impact report SHALL use random selection with graceful failure: one id SHALL be chosen at random from the entries that resolve to a cached `AudioData`; unknown ids SHALL log a warning and be excluded; an empty `sound_impact` or a list with no known ids SHALL play nothing. The per-victim report SHALL apply only to combat entities; cell overlays (bridge span, ice, tiberium) SHALL be excluded, because their damage is applied by the warhead-gated cell pass, which plays the shot's single report once at the impact point. One resolved shot SHALL therefore play the impact report at most once, never once per damaged cell victim. Damage whose `damage_type` does not resolve to a `WarheadData` (for example vehicle crush or drowning) SHALL be silent. Impact playback SHALL NOT require the victim to have a `VoiceComponent`.

#### Scenario: Hit plays the warhead impact report

- **WHEN** a projectile or hitscan shot dealing warhead "HE" damages a victim and HE.sound_impact = "EXPNEW06"
- **THEN** "EXPNEW06" plays at the victim's position

#### Scenario: Impact picks one report at random

- **WHEN** a warhead with sound_impact = "EXPNEW06,EXPNEW10" damages a victim
- **THEN** exactly one of EXPNEW06 or EXPNEW10 plays at the victim's position

#### Scenario: Mixed entity and overlay hit plays one impact report

- **WHEN** a shot damages both a combat entity and a cell overlay at the same impact point and the warhead has a non-empty `sound_impact`
- **THEN** exactly one impact report plays at that point, not one per victim

#### Scenario: Empty impact report is silent

- **WHEN** a warhead with an empty sound_impact damages a victim
- **THEN** no impact sound plays and no error is raised

#### Scenario: Unknown impact id warns and is skipped

- **WHEN** a warhead with sound_impact = "NO_SUCH_ID,EXPNEW10" damages a victim
- **THEN** a warning is logged and EXPNEW10 plays

#### Scenario: Non-warhead damage is silent

- **WHEN** an entity takes damage whose damage_type is not a registered warhead id
- **THEN** no impact sound plays and gameplay continues normally
