## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Camera far clip for shadow concentration
The Camera3D SHALL use a `far` clip value that concentrates shadow resolution on the visible gameplay area. For a 512×512 map with orthogonal projection, `far` SHALL be set to 400.0 units.

#### Scenario: Shadow map covers visible area
- **WHEN** the camera renders the scene with `far = 400.0`
- **THEN** the shadow map covers only the visible gameplay area (~400 units depth)

#### Scenario: Map edges not clipped
- **WHEN** the camera is positioned at any valid map location
- **THEN** terrain and entities at map edges are not clipped by the far plane

### Requirement: Orthogonal shadow mode
The DirectionalLight3D SHALL use orthogonal shadow mode (`directional_shadow_mode = 0`) instead of PSSM 4-split.

#### Scenario: Shadow mode configuration
- **WHEN** the DirectionalLight3D is configured
- **THEN** `directional_shadow_mode` is set to 0 (Orthogonal)

### Requirement: Light angular distance preserved
The DirectionalLight3D SHALL retain `light_angular_distance = 1.1` to maintain soft shadow edges appropriate for the game's visual style.

#### Scenario: Angular distance configuration
- **WHEN** the DirectionalLight3D is configured
- **THEN** `light_angular_distance` is set to 1.1

### Requirement: Shadow blur preserved
The DirectionalLight3D SHALL retain `shadow_blur = 0.9` to maintain soft shadow edges appropriate for the game's visual style.

#### Scenario: Shadow blur configuration
- **WHEN** the DirectionalLight3D is configured
- **THEN** `shadow_blur` is set to 0.9

### Requirement: Shadow map resolution
The project SHALL use a shadow map resolution of 4096 for the directional light.

#### Scenario: Shadow map size configuration
- **WHEN** the project settings are loaded
- **THEN** `rendering/lights_and_shadows/directional_shadow/size` is 4096
