# selection-manager Specification

## Purpose

`SelectionManager` tracks the player's selected entities and issues group moves, distributing sharers to cells by capacity and non-sharers by offset formation.
## Requirements
### Requirement: SelectionManager tracks selected entities
`SelectionManager` SHALL be an autoload singleton maintaining `selected_entities: Array[SelectComponent]`. It emits `selection_changed(selected_entities)` whenever the selection set changes.

#### Scenario: Select single entity
- **WHEN** `select_entity(entity)` is called without shift
- **THEN** all previously selected entities are deselected, the new entity is selected, and `selection_changed` emits with the new selection

#### Scenario: Shift-click adds to selection
- **WHEN** `select_entity(entity, shift_pressed=true)` is called
- **THEN** the entity is added to the existing selection without deselecting others

#### Scenario: Shift-click removes from selection
- **WHEN** `select_entity(entity, shift_pressed=true)` is called on an already-selected entity
- **THEN** the entity is removed from the selection

#### Scenario: Deselect all
- **WHEN** `deselect_all()` is called
- **THEN** all entities are deselected and `selection_changed` emits with empty array

### Requirement: Hover preview
SelectionManager SHALL manage hover preview state. `set_hover_preview(enabled, entity)` toggles hover visual on the hovered entity and emits `hover_changed(entity)`.

#### Scenario: Hover entity
- **WHEN** `set_hover_preview(true, entity)` is called
- **THEN** `entity.set_is_hovering(true)` is called and `hover_changed` emits

#### Scenario: Unhover entity
- **WHEN** `set_hover_preview(false)` is called
- **THEN** the previously hovered entity's `set_is_hovering(false)` is called

### Requirement: Formation move for vehicles
When multiple vehicles are selected and a move command is issued, `request_move(target)` SHALL maintain formation offsets. Each vehicle moves to a position offset from the target by its relative offset from the selection center, clamped to ±2 cells.

#### Scenario: Two-vehicle formation
- **WHEN** two vehicles are 4 cells apart and move command is issued
- **THEN** each vehicle maintains its relative offset from the group center at the destination

#### Scenario: Formation offset clamped
- **WHEN** a vehicle is more than 2 cells from the selection center
- **THEN** its offset is clamped to ±2 cells at the destination

#### Scenario: Skip formation
- **WHEN** `request_move(target, skip_formation=true)` is called
- **THEN** all vehicles move to the exact target position (no formation offsets)

### Requirement: Infantry cell pre-assignment
When infantry units are selected and a move command is issued, `request_move()` SHALL pre-assign each infantry to a cell using spiral search from the target cell, with max 3 per cell based on `CellReservation` combined capacity (physical idle infantry + in-flight claims). `request_move()` SHALL NOT pre-assign sub-slots; slot assignment SHALL occur at movement start inside `MovementController.set_target_position` via `CellReservation.reserve_sub_slot`.

#### Scenario: Three infantry to same cell
- **WHEN** 3 infantry move to a cell with no existing infantry and no claims
- **THEN** all 3 are assigned to the target cell, and each claims a distinct sub-slot (0, 1, 2) at movement start

#### Scenario: Infantry overflow to adjacent cells
- **WHEN** 4 infantry move to a cell
- **THEN** 3 are assigned to the target cell, the 4th is assigned to the nearest free adjacent cell

#### Scenario: Target cell already has infantry
- **WHEN** 2 infantry move to a cell that already has 1 idle infantry
- **THEN** the 2 new infantry fill the remaining capacity, totaling 3 in the cell

#### Scenario: In-flight claims fill capacity
- **WHEN** a cell has idle infantry plus in-flight claims totaling 3
- **THEN** `_find_infantry_cell()` assigns new infantry to a neighboring cell instead

### Requirement: Batched move dispatch
SelectionManager SHALL dispatch pending moves in batches of 8 per frame via `_process()`. This prevents frame spikes when moving large groups. Each pending mover SHALL resolve its path via greedy-first movement: the unit's MovementController attempts bounded greedy descent toward its assigned cell (`Pathfinder.try_greedy_step`) and falls back to per-unit `Pathfinder.find_path` only when greedy descent stalls. SelectionManager SHALL NOT compute group-wide frontiers or precompute paths for sharers; every mover's path is resolved per-unit at dispatch time. SelectionManager SHALL keep one batch-lifetime terrain-cost cache (`Pathfinder` per-cell terrain cost memo) alive across the drain frames of a single move order so all units in the order share cost data; the cache SHALL be discarded (or its generation invalidated) when blocked/reservation state changes.

#### Scenario: Large group moved in batches
- **WHEN** 20 units are queued for movement
- **THEN** only 8 units receive their move command per frame, completing over 3 frames

#### Scenario: Sharer-only group uses greedy-first per-unit dispatch
- **WHEN** a selection is entirely infantry cell-sharers with one `LocomotorData` and a move is issued
- **THEN** every unit resolves its path per-unit (greedy first, A* on stall) with no group-wide frontier computation, and all units share one batch-lifetime terrain-cost cache

#### Scenario: Mixed selection keeps per-unit dispatch
- **WHEN** a selection contains a mix of sharers and non-sharers (vehicles, crushers, jumpjets)
- **THEN** every unit resolves its path per-unit (greedy first, A* on stall)

#### Scenario: Cache lifetime spans the order drain
- **WHEN** a move order for 50 units drains across ~6 frames
- **THEN** the terrain-cost cache is reused across the drain frames and invalidated when blocked/reservation state changes

### Requirement: Local entity filtering
In multiplayer, `request_move()` SHALL only move entities owned by the local player. Non-local entities are skipped.

#### Scenario: Local entity moves
- **WHEN** an entity has `player_id == PlayerManager.get_local_player_id()`
- **THEN** it receives the move command

#### Scenario: Remote entity skipped
- **WHEN** an entity has a different `player_id`
- **THEN** it does not receive the move command

### Requirement: Deploy transition handling
Entities with DeployComponent that are transitioning (deploying/undeploying) SHALL be skipped during move commands. Their cells are reserved for other units.

#### Scenario: Transitioning entity skipped
- **WHEN** an entity has DeployComponent and `is_transitioning() == true`
- **THEN** it is skipped in `request_move()` and does not receive a move command

### Requirement: Cell reservation during move
Before issuing move commands, SelectionManager SHALL clear all existing reservations, then reserve each selected entity's current cell. If a vehicle's target cell is already reserved, a fallback target is found via spiral search. This requirement covers vehicle cell reservation only; infantry sub-slot claims are handled by `CellReservation`.

#### Scenario: Reserve current cells
- **WHEN** `request_move()` is called
- **THEN** all existing reservations are cleared, and each entity's current cell is reserved

#### Scenario: Fallback on reserved target
- **WHEN** a vehicle's target cell is already reserved
- **THEN** `CellUtil.spiral_first_free()` finds the nearest available cell within radius 8

### Requirement: Rally point setting
`request_set_rally_point(target_position)` SHALL set the rally point on all selected entities that have a RallyPointComponent.

#### Scenario: Set rally point
- **WHEN** `request_set_rally_point(world_pos)` is called with a building selected
- **THEN** `RallyPointComponent.set_rally_point(cell)` is called with the target cell

### Requirement: Visual selection synchronization
SelectionManager SHALL synchronize its internal selection list with the visual `is_selected` state on SelectComponents. The primary path SHALL be event-driven: `SelectComponent.set_is_selected()` emits a selection-state signal and SelectionManager reconciles that entity immediately. A low-frequency reconcile (at most 10 Hz) SHALL remain as a safety net for external direct writes to `is_selected`. The list SHALL NOT be rescanning the "selectable" group every frame.

#### Scenario: Visual selection out of sync (event-driven)
- **WHEN** a SelectComponent sets `is_selected = true` via `set_is_selected()` and is not in `selected_entities`
- **THEN** it is added to `selected_entities` on the same frame

#### Scenario: List contains visually unselected (event-driven)
- **WHEN** a SelectComponent sets `is_selected = false` via `set_is_selected()` while in `selected_entities`
- **THEN** it is removed from `selected_entities` on the same frame

#### Scenario: External mutation reconciled at low frequency
- **WHEN** a SelectComponent's `is_selected` is written directly (not via `set_is_selected()`)
- **THEN** `selected_entities` is reconciled within 100 ms

### Requirement: Sharers distribute by capacity
The system SHALL separate sharers from non-sharers when processing a group move command. Units whose MovementController `shares_cell()` returns true SHALL be distributed to cells near the target with at most `CellSubPositions.get_slot_count()` per cell, using `CellReservation` combined capacity. Each sharer SHALL be assigned a sub-slot at movement start inside `MovementController.set_target_position`; SelectionManager SHALL NOT pre-assign slots. Non-sharers SHALL use the existing offset-based vehicle formation.

#### Scenario: Group move with mixed units
- **WHEN** a player issues a move command with 6 sharers and 2 non-sharers selected
- **THEN** sharers are spread across cells near the target (≤ capacity per cell) using combined capacity, and non-sharers use existing offset logic

#### Scenario: Sharer cell search
- **WHEN** `_find_sharer_cell()` is called with a target cell at capacity
- **THEN** it spirals outward to find the nearest cell below capacity

### Requirement: Select voice playback
On a single-entity selection via `select_entity(entity)`, SelectionManager SHALL play a random variant from the entity's `VoiceData.select` event when the entity has a `VoiceComponent` with `voice_data` and is a local unit. Group and box selection events SHALL play exactly ONE select voice from the NW-most unit — never one per unit. Voice playback SHALL go through `AudioManager.play_voice` (camera-centered radio chatter).

#### Scenario: Selecting a local unit plays its select voice
- **WHEN** `select_entity(entity)` is called on a local unit with a non-empty `VoiceData.select`
- **THEN** one random `select` variant SHALL be played via AudioManager

#### Scenario: Selecting an enemy unit is silent
- **WHEN** `select_entity(entity)` is called on an enemy unit (non-local player_id)
- **THEN** no voice SHALL play

#### Scenario: Group select plays one voice
- **WHEN** `play_select_voice_for_entities(entities)` is called for a multi-unit selection event
- **THEN** exactly one select voice plays, from the NW-most unit

#### Scenario: Add-entity alone is silent
- **WHEN** `add_entity(entity)` is called directly (not via `select_entity` or the group path)
- **THEN** no voice SHALL play — voices are deferred to the selection event

### Requirement: NW-most voice picker
`get_northwest_most(entities)` SHALL deterministically pick the single speaking unit as the one closest to the top of the screen (smallest projected screen Y), tie-broken by the largest screen X (right-most). Without a camera it SHALL fall back to world-space ordering (smallest +Z, then largest +X).

#### Scenario: Top-most unit picked
- **WHEN** a camera exists and three units are candidates
- **THEN** the unit with the smallest projected screen Y is returned

#### Scenario: World-space fallback ordering
- **WHEN** no camera is present (headless/test context)
- **THEN** the unit with smallest +Z (then largest +X) is returned
