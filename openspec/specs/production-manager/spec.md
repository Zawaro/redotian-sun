# production-manager Specification

## Purpose

Manage per-player production queues keyed by `player_id:factory_type`: start, stack, and
cancel items; fund builds gradually as they progress (stalling and resuming on insufficient
funds); scale speed with factory count and power; route completed buildings to placement and
completed units to a free factory.
## Requirements
### Requirement: ProductionManager manages per-player production queues
`ProductionManager` SHALL be an autoload singleton managing production queues keyed by `player_id:factory_type`. It emits `production_started`, `production_progress`, `production_completed`, `production_cancelled`, and `production_paused` signals.

#### Scenario: Queue key format
- **WHEN** player 0 builds infantry
- **THEN** queue key is `"0:infantry"`

### Requirement: Start production
`start_production(player_id, entity_data, count)` SHALL add items to the queue after verifying that the entity has a `buildable_queue` and that prerequisites are met (via PrerequisiteSystem). It SHALL NOT require the player to afford the full cost up front — production is funded as it builds. Returns false if the queue type is empty or prerequisites fail.

#### Scenario: Start production — success
- **WHEN** player has prerequisites and queue is empty
- **THEN** item is added, `production_started` emits, returns true

#### Scenario: Start production — prerequisite fails
- **WHEN** player lacks required buildings
- **THEN** returns false, no item added

#### Scenario: Start production — zero balance still queues
- **WHEN** player has prerequisites but a zero credit balance
- **THEN** the item is added and `production_started` emits; it stalls until credits arrive

#### Scenario: Stack incrementing
- **WHEN** last queue item is the same entity type
- **THEN** count increments (up to MAX_STACK = 25) instead of adding new item

### Requirement: Gradual cost deduction
During production, credits SHALL be deducted gradually over the build time at rate `cost / build_time * speed`. A fractional accumulator prevents rounding loss. Progress SHALL advance only when the current increment's cost is successfully deducted; when `EconomyManager.deduct` returns false the queue SHALL stall — holding progress and the accumulator — and resume once funds are available. `item.deducted` SHALL increase only by amounts actually deducted. On completion, any remaining balance is deducted; if that deduction fails, completion SHALL be withheld until funds arrive.

#### Scenario: Gradual deduction during production
- **WHEN** a 1000-credit entity with 10s build time is producing with sufficient funds
- **THEN** approximately 100 credits are deducted per second

#### Scenario: Remaining balance on completion
- **WHEN** production completes and deducted total < cost
- **THEN** the remaining balance is deducted to reach exact cost

#### Scenario: Starved queue holds progress
- **WHEN** the player's balance reaches zero mid-production
- **THEN** progress stops advancing, no further credits are deducted, and the queue stalls

#### Scenario: Failed deduction is not counted
- **WHEN** an increment cannot be deducted
- **THEN** `item.deducted` is unchanged and the accumulator keeps the owed fraction

#### Scenario: Completion is withheld until paid
- **WHEN** progress reaches 100% but the residual balance cannot be deducted
- **THEN** the item does not complete, does not enter ready-to-place, and stalls

### Requirement: Production speed bonus from multiple factories
Production speed SHALL be `1.0 + (factory_count - 1) * 0.25` where `factory_count` is the number of matching-type factories owned by the player. Primary factory is preferred for spawning.

#### Scenario: Single factory
- **WHEN** player owns 1 infantry factory
- **THEN** production speed is 1.0

#### Scenario: Three factories
- **WHEN** player owns 3 vehicle factories
- **THEN** production speed is 1.5

### Requirement: Cancel production with refund
`cancel_production(player_id, queue_key, index, count)` SHALL remove items and refund only the amount already deducted. If count >= item count, entire item is removed.

#### Scenario: Cancel full item
- **WHEN** item has 500 deducted and is fully cancelled
- **THEN** 500 credits are refunded, item removed

#### Scenario: Cancel partial count
- **WHEN** stacked item has count 5 and count=1 is cancelled
- **THEN** count decrements to 4, no refund (waiting items not yet deducted)

### Requirement: Pause and resume production
`pause_production(queue_key, index)` and `resume_production(queue_key, index)` SHALL toggle the `is_paused` flag on queue items. Paused items do not advance.

#### Scenario: Pause production
- **WHEN** `pause_production()` is called on active item
- **THEN** `item.is_paused = true`, timer stops advancing

#### Scenario: Resume production
- **WHEN** `resume_production()` is called on paused item
- **THEN** `item.is_paused = false`, timer resumes

### Requirement: Building completion enters placement mode
When a building completes, it enters ready-to-place state. `get_ready_buildings(player_id)` returns the list of ready `EntityData`. Each ready entry SHALL track the amount already deducted for that building. `place_ready_building(player_id, entity_id)` triggers BuildingManager build mode with skip deduction. `cancel_ready_building(player_id, entity_id)` SHALL refund the tracked deducted amount for that entry.

#### Scenario: Building completes
- **WHEN** production reaches 100% for a building
- **THEN** building is added to `_ready_to_place` with its deducted amount recorded, `_waiting_for_placement` blocks queue

#### Scenario: Place ready building
- **WHEN** `place_ready_building()` is called
- **THEN** BuildingManager enters build mode with skip deduction flag

#### Scenario: Cancel ready building
- **WHEN** `cancel_ready_building()` is called
- **THEN** the amount recorded as deducted for that entry is refunded, and the player's waiting queues unblock

#### Scenario: Build mode exited without placing
- **WHEN** BuildingManager exits build mode without placing, emitting `build_mode_changed(false, player_id)`
- **THEN** only the exiting player's `_waiting_for_placement` queues unblock, leaving other players' queues untouched

### Requirement: Unit spawning on completion
When a unit completes, ProductionManager SHALL find a free factory via `_find_factories()` and call `FactoryComponent.on_unit_produced()`. If no factory is free, the unit enters ready-to-spawn state. When the fallback spawner cannot find a free exit cell near the factory, the unit SHALL NOT spawn inside the building; it SHALL enter ready-to-spawn state with a warning.

#### Scenario: Unit spawns via factory
- **WHEN** unit completes and free factory exists
- **THEN** FactoryComponent.on_unit_produced() is called

#### Scenario: No free factory
- **WHEN** unit completes but all matching factories are busy
- **THEN** unit enters `_ready_to_spawn` list

#### Scenario: No free exit cell in fallback spawn
- **WHEN** a unit completes at a factory without FactoryComponent and no free exit cell exists within the search radius
- **THEN** the unit is NOT placed on the factory's own cell
- **THEN** a warning is logged and the unit enters `_ready_to_spawn`

#### Scenario: Ready-to-spawn retry
- **WHEN** `retry_ready_spawn()` is called
- **THEN** spawn is attempted again

#### Scenario: Ready-to-spawn cancel
- **WHEN** `cancel_ready_spawn()` is called
- **THEN** full cost is refunded

### Requirement: Debug instant-build mode
When `debug_menu.no_build_time == true`, production SHALL complete instantly in one frame.

#### Scenario: Debug mode active
- **WHEN** `no_build_time` is true
- **THEN** production completes immediately, no timer advancement

### Requirement: Zero build time handling
If `entity_data.get_build_time()` returns 0 or negative, production SHALL complete immediately.

#### Scenario: Zero build time
- **WHEN** entity has build_time = 0
- **THEN** item completes in one frame

### Requirement: Low power slows production
ProductionManager SHALL multiply each queue's effective production speed by the owner's current build-rate multiplier from PowerGrid (1.0 when healthy). Production SHALL slow under power deficit but SHALL NOT halt. The per-queue speed cache SHALL be invalidated when PowerGrid emits `grid_state_changed` for the queue's player. When PowerGrid is absent (e.g. isolated unit tests), the multiplier SHALL fall back to 1.0.

#### Scenario: Healthy grid keeps normal speed
- **WHEN** a player's grid is healthy and a queue computes its speed
- **THEN** the speed equals the existing multiple-factory speed with no power multiplier

#### Scenario: Deficit slows production
- **WHEN** a player's grid is in low power with build-rate multiplier r
- **THEN** every queue of that player advances at `speed × r` (e.g. ≈ 60% with output 100 against drain 150)

#### Scenario: Recovery restores speed
- **WHEN** the grid returns to healthy
- **THEN** the next speed lookup returns the unmultiplied speed

#### Scenario: Cache invalidated on grid change
- **WHEN** `grid_state_changed(player_id)` emits
- **THEN** cached speeds for that player's queues are dropped and recomputed on next lookup

### Requirement: Production stalls and resumes on insufficient funds
`ProductionManager` SHALL emit `production_stalled(queue_key)` once when a queue transitions from funded to starved, and `production_resumed(queue_key)` once when it transitions back. The queue key is `"player_id:factory_type"`. The signals SHALL be edge-triggered so a starved queue emits exactly one stall signal regardless of how many frames it remains starved.

#### Scenario: Stall signal fires once
- **WHEN** a producing queue's balance drops below the current increment
- **THEN** `production_stalled` emits exactly once for that queue key

#### Scenario: Resume signal fires on recovery
- **WHEN** credits are added and the starved queue deducts its next increment
- **THEN** `production_resumed` emits once for that queue key

#### Scenario: No stall while funded
- **WHEN** a queue deducts every increment successfully
- **THEN** neither `production_stalled` nor `production_resumed` emits

#### Scenario: Stall state cleared with the queue
- **WHEN** a starved queue is cancelled or completes
- **THEN** its stall state is cleared and a later re-queue is not treated as already stalled
