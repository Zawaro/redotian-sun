# entity-factory Specification

## Purpose

EntityFactory creates entities from EntityData resources and attaches components by data-driven rules.
## Requirements
### Requirement: EntityFactory creates entities from data
The system SHALL provide an `EntityFactory.gd` autoload singleton that creates entities from EntityData resources. The factory SHALL instantiate a base `Entity.tscn` scene and add components dynamically based on data properties.

#### Scenario: Create infantry entity
- **WHEN** `EntityFactory.create_entity("E1")` is called
- **THEN** the factory looks up EntityData with id "E1", instantiates a base scene, adds StatsComponent, HealthComponent, HitboxComponent, SelectComponent, MovementController, CombatComponent, ArtComponent, and returns the configured entity

#### Scenario: Create terrain entity
- **WHEN** `EntityFactory.create_entity("TREE01")` is called
- **THEN** the factory instantiates a base scene, adds StatsComponent, HealthComponent (if strength > 0), HitboxComponent, FoundationComponent, ArtComponent — but NOT SelectComponent (entity_type = TERRAIN)

#### Scenario: Create building entity
- **WHEN** `EntityFactory.create_entity("GAPOWR")` is called
- **THEN** the factory instantiates a base scene, adds StatsComponent, HealthComponent, HitboxComponent, SelectComponent, FoundationComponent, PowerComponent, ArtComponent, and returns the configured entity

### Requirement: Component addition rules
The factory SHALL add components based on these rules:
- StatsComponent: ALWAYS
- HealthComponent: if `strength > 0`
- HitboxComponent: if `resource_category == ""` (skipped for resource entities — they use interact hitbox on layer 17)
- SelectComponent: if `entity_type != TERRAIN`
- CombatComponent: if `weapons.size() > 0`
- GuardComponent: if `weapons.size() > 0`
- MovementController: if `speed > 0`
- FoundationComponent: if `foundation != Vector2i(1,1)`
- PowerComponent: if `power != 0` or `powered == true`
- RadarComponent: if `radar == true`
- FactoryComponent: if `buildable_queue != ""`
- TransportComponent: if `passengers > 0` or `harvester == true`
- PassengerComponent: if `entity_type == INFANTRY`
- SpecialAbilityComponent: if any ability flag is true
- ArtComponent: if `resource_category != "tiberium"` (skipped for tiberium resource entities)
- ResourceTreeComponent: if `resource_category == "tiberium_tree"`
- ResourceComponent: if `resource_category != ""` and `resource_category != "tiberium_tree"` (trees are spawners, not harvestable nodes)
- HarvestComponent: if `harvester == true`
- DockHostComponent: if `dock_position != Vector3.ZERO`
- DockClientComponent: if `dock != ""`
- DockUnloadComponent: if `dock_unload == true`
- FreeUnitComponent: if `free_unit != ""`
- VoiceComponent: if `voice_data != null`

#### Scenario: Minimal entity (terrain rock)
- **WHEN** EntityData has `entity_type = TERRAIN`, `strength = 0`, `foundation = Vector2i(1,1)`, `speed = 0`, `weapons = []`
- **THEN** entity gets only StatsComponent, HitboxComponent, ArtComponent

#### Scenario: Full entity (Nod Buggy)
- **WHEN** EntityData has `entity_type = VEHICLE`, `strength = 220`, `speed = 10`, `weapons = [raider_cannon]`, `foundation = Vector2i(1,1)`
- **THEN** entity gets StatsComponent, HealthComponent, HitboxComponent, SelectComponent, CombatComponent, GuardComponent, MovementController, ArtComponent

#### Scenario: Harvester entity
- **WHEN** EntityData has `harvester = true`, `dock = "PROC"`, `storage = 1`, `speed = 5.0`
- **THEN** entity gets StatsComponent, HealthComponent, HitboxComponent, SelectComponent, MovementController, TransportComponent, HarvestComponent, DockClientComponent, ArtComponent

#### Scenario: Refinery entity
- **WHEN** EntityData has `dock_position = Vector3(6, 0, 2)`, `dock_unload = true`, `accepted_resource_categories = ["tiberium"]`, `free_unit = "HARV"`
- **THEN** entity gets StatsComponent, HealthComponent, HitboxComponent, SelectComponent, FoundationComponent, DockHostComponent, DockUnloadComponent, FreeUnitComponent, ArtComponent

#### Scenario: Resource crystal entity
- **WHEN** EntityData has `resource_category = "tiberium"`, `resource_type_id = "tiberium_green"`, `strength = 300`
- **THEN** entity gets StatsComponent, HealthComponent, ResourceComponent, ArtComponent (no SelectComponent — entity_type = TERRAIN)

#### Scenario: Resource tree entity
- **WHEN** EntityData has `spawned_entity_id = "TIB"`, `radius_cells = 8`, `node_count = 12`
- **THEN** entity gets StatsComponent, FoundationComponent, ResourceTreeComponent, ArtComponent (no HealthComponent if strength = 0, no SelectComponent)

#### Scenario: Voiced unit entity
- **WHEN** EntityData has a `voice_data` reference (e.g. a VoiceData .tres)
- **THEN** entity gets a VoiceComponent holding that reference, in addition to its normal components

#### Scenario: Infantry entity
- **WHEN** EntityData has `entity_type = INFANTRY`
- **THEN** entity gets a PassengerComponent configured from its EntityData (including `pip_color`), in addition to its normal components

#### Scenario: Vehicle entity gets no PassengerComponent
- **WHEN** EntityData has `entity_type = VEHICLE`
- **THEN** entity gets no PassengerComponent

### Requirement: Component wiring
The factory SHALL wire component references programmatically after instantiation. HitboxComponent and SelectComponent SHALL receive a reference to HealthComponent.

#### Scenario: Health component reference wiring
- **WHEN** an entity has both HealthComponent and HitboxComponent
- **THEN** HitboxComponent.health_component is set to the HealthComponent node

### Requirement: EntityFactory caching
The factory SHALL cache loaded EntityData resources by id for fast lookup. The factory SHALL provide `get_all_by_type(entity_type: EntityType) -> Array[EntityData]` to query cached entities by category.

#### Scenario: Repeated entity creation
- **WHEN** `create_entity("E1")` is called 10 times
- **THEN** EntityData is loaded once and cached, not re-loaded from disk each time

#### Scenario: Query entities by type
- **WHEN** `get_all_by_type(EntityData.EntityType.BUILDING)` is called
- **THEN** the factory returns an Array[EntityData] containing all cached entities where `entity_type == BUILDING`

#### Scenario: Query returns empty for no matches
- **WHEN** `get_all_by_type(EntityData.EntityType.AIRCRAFT)` is called and no aircraft entities are cached
- **THEN** the factory returns an empty array

#### Scenario: Query includes all subdirectories
- **WHEN** EntityData files exist in `games/ts/entities/structures/gdi/` and `games/ts/entities/structures/nod/`
- **THEN** `get_all_by_type(BUILDING)` returns entities from both directories

#### Scenario: Invalid entity id
- **WHEN** `create_entity("INVALID_ID")` is called and no matching EntityData exists
- **THEN** the factory returns null and logs an error

#### Scenario: Base scene missing
- **WHEN** `Entity.tscn` is not found at the expected path
- **THEN** the factory logs an error and returns null

### Requirement: Death cleanup with die voice
On `HealthComponent.health_zero`, EntityFactory SHALL free the entity. If the entity has a `VoiceComponent` with a non-empty `VoiceData.die` set, EntityFactory SHALL play a random die variant via `AudioManager.play_voice` before freeing. Entities without a die voice set play nothing.

#### Scenario: Death plays die voice
- **WHEN** a unit with a non-empty `VoiceData.die` reaches zero health
- **THEN** a random die variant SHALL play and the entity SHALL be freed

#### Scenario: Voiceless death is silent
- **WHEN** an entity without a VoiceComponent, or with an empty `die` set, reaches zero health
- **THEN** no sound SHALL play and the entity SHALL be freed

### Requirement: Factory content branches keyed on data flags
`EntityFactory` and `EntityPlacer` SHALL select resource-spawner, procedural-resource and breakable-surface behavior from `EntityData` boolean flags, and SHALL NOT compare against Tiberian Sun category or id strings such as `"tiberium"`, `"tiberium_tree"` or an `"ICE"` legacy-id prefix.

#### Scenario: Spawner by flag
- **WHEN** an entity's data has `resource_spawner = true`
- **THEN** the factory adds the resource-tree component and the `resource_trees` group without matching a category string

#### Scenario: Procedural resource by flag
- **WHEN** an entity's data flags a procedural resource visual
- **THEN** the factory omits the ArtComponent without matching `"tiberium"`

#### Scenario: Breakable surface by flag
- **WHEN** an entity's data has `breakable_surface = true` and the game enables `breakable_ice`
- **THEN** the factory attaches the breakable-surface component without inspecting `legacy_id`

### Requirement: Ice component gated by feature flag
`EntityFactory` SHALL attach the breakable-surface component only when `GameContext.has_feature("breakable_ice")` is true. When the flag is off the entity SHALL spawn normally with no ice group membership.

#### Scenario: Ice disabled
- **WHEN** an entity with `breakable_surface = true` spawns in a game without `breakable_ice`
- **THEN** it has no IceComponent and is not in the `ice` group

### Requirement: Bridge component attached to bridge overlay entities
`EntityFactory` SHALL attach a `BridgeComponent` to an entity whose `EntityData` declares a bridge kind. The component SHALL join the `"bridge"` group so the live registry resolves the entity's `(cell, level)` surface, and SHALL expose the entity's bridge kind (low/high/rail), end flag, piece identifier, deck level, and walkable surface height. Non-bridge entities SHALL NOT receive the component. The attach branch SHALL pass the entity's deck level and kind into the component.

#### Scenario: Bridge entity gets component
- **WHEN** a bridge overlay entity is created
- **THEN** it has a `BridgeComponent` and is a member of the `"bridge"` group

#### Scenario: Non-bridge entity unaffected
- **WHEN** a non-bridge entity is created
- **THEN** it has no `BridgeComponent` and is not in the `"bridge"` group

#### Scenario: Component publishes deck surface data
- **WHEN** a high bridge entity's component resolves its surface
- **THEN** it reports the deck level, kind, and the surface height (ground plus `bridge_rise`)

#### Scenario: Rail bridge attaches as high
- **WHEN** a rail bridge entity is created
- **THEN** its component reports the rail kind on a high deck level
