## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: BuildingManager manages build mode lifecycle
`BuildingManager` SHALL be an autoload singleton managing build mode entry, preview, placement, selling, and repairing. It emits `build_mode_changed(is_active)`, `building_placed(building, entity_data)`, `building_sold(building, entity_data)`, and `building_repaired(building, entity_data)` signals.

#### Scenario: Enter build mode
- **WHEN** `enter_build_mode(building_type)` is called
- **THEN** `is_build_mode` becomes true, preview appears, `build_mode_changed(true)` emits
- **AND** `_skip_input_frames = 1` prevents the triggering click from placing

#### Scenario: Toggle off same building
- **WHEN** `enter_build_mode(building_type)` is called while already in build mode for the same type
- **THEN** build mode exits

#### Scenario: Exit build mode
- **WHEN** `exit_build_mode()` is called or right-click/Escape is pressed
- **THEN** `is_build_mode` becomes false, preview is freed, `build_mode_changed(false)` emits

### Requirement: Placement validation
`can_place(building_type, origin_cell)` SHALL check every foundation cell for map bounds and play-area bounds, SHALL delegate cell availability and terrain height variation to `FoundationComponent.footprint_buildable(building_type.foundation, origin_cell)`, and SHALL enforce the adjacency requirement `building_type.adjacent`. Under debug place-anywhere mode only the map-bounds check applies.

#### Scenario: Valid placement
- **WHEN** all foundation cells are free, in bounds, height variation is within limit, and any adjacency requirement is satisfied
- **THEN** `can_place()` returns true

#### Scenario: Cell occupied by building
- **WHEN** any foundation cell overlaps an existing building's footprint
- **THEN** `can_place()` returns false

#### Scenario: Cell has resource
- **WHEN** any foundation cell contains a resource entity
- **THEN** `can_place()` returns false

#### Scenario: Height variation too steep
- **WHEN** max height - min height across foundation cells exceeds `TerrainSystem.HEIGHT_STEP`
- **THEN** `can_place()` returns false

#### Scenario: Adjacency requirement unmet
- **WHEN** `building_type.adjacent > 0` and no friendly building has an occupied cell within Chebyshev distance `adjacent` of any footprint cell
- **THEN** `can_place()` returns false

#### Scenario: Adjacency requirement met
- **WHEN** `building_type.adjacent > 0` and a friendly building has an occupied cell within Chebyshev distance `adjacent` of a footprint cell
- **THEN** the adjacency check passes

#### Scenario: No adjacency requirement
- **WHEN** `building_type.adjacent <= 0`
- **THEN** the adjacency check always passes

#### Scenario: Debug place-anywhere mode
- **WHEN** `debug_menu.place_anywhere == true`
- **THEN** only bounds check is enforced, cell/height/adjacency checks are skipped

### Requirement: Building placement
`place_building(building_type, origin_cell)` SHALL validate placement, deduct cost (unless `_skip_next_deduction` is set), create the entity via EntityFactory, register its occupied cells (foundation minus bib) in SpatialHash, register any bib cells, flatten terrain under the footprint via `TerrainSystem.flatten_footprint`, register the building in PrerequisiteSystem, and emit `building_placed`.

#### Scenario: Place building with deduction
- **WHEN** `place_building()` is called without skip flag
- **THEN** cost is deducted from player credits via EconomyManager

#### Scenario: Place building with skip deduction
- **WHEN** `set_skip_next_deduction()` was called before `place_building()`
- **THEN** cost is NOT deducted (already paid via production queue)

#### Scenario: Place building registers cells
- **WHEN** a 2×2 building is placed at cell (5, 3)
- **THEN** cells (5,3), (6,3), (5,4), (6,4) are registered in SpatialHash

#### Scenario: Place building registers bib cells
- **WHEN** a building with bib cells is placed
- **THEN** bib cells are registered separately in SpatialHash and are excluded from the occupied building cells

#### Scenario: Place building flattens terrain
- **WHEN** a building is placed over a footprint with a one-step height variation
- **THEN** the footprint region is levelled to its maximum height

#### Scenario: Place building resumes production
- **WHEN** a building from the production queue is placed
- **THEN** `ProductionManager.clear_waiting_for_placement()` is called

### Requirement: Cell availability check
`_is_cell_free(cell)` SHALL delegate to `FoundationComponent.is_cell_buildable(cell)`, returning false if the cell is a building cell, blocked, has an entity with MovementController, a bib cell, has a resource, or terrain type is not "" or "clear".

#### Scenario: Free cell
- **WHEN** a cell has no buildings, entities, resources, and is "clear" terrain
- **THEN** `_is_cell_free()` returns true

#### Scenario: Occupied cell
- **WHEN** a cell has a building footprint
- **THEN** `_is_cell_free()` returns false

### Requirement: Building sell
`sell_building(building_node)` SHALL refund 50% of the building's cost, unregister from PrerequisiteSystem, unregister cells from SpatialHash, deselect the building, emit `building_sold`, and free the node.

#### Scenario: Sell building
- **WHEN** `sell_building(building)` is called on a placed building
- **THEN** 50% of cost is added to player credits
- **AND** building is removed from game

#### Scenario: Sell building not found
- **WHEN** `sell_building(node)` is called on a node not in the buildings list
- **THEN** returns false

### Requirement: Building repair
`repair_building(building_node)` SHALL heal the building by 8 HP (capped at max health). Returns false if already at full health.

#### Scenario: Repair damaged building
- **WHEN** `repair_building(building)` is called on a building with 80/100 HP
- **THEN** health increases to 88/100

#### Scenario: Repair at full health
- **WHEN** `repair_building(building)` is called on a building at full health
- **THEN** returns false, no change

#### Scenario: Repair capped at max
- **WHEN** `repair_building(building)` is called on a building with 96/100 HP
- **THEN** health increases to 100/100 (capped, not 104)

### Requirement: Building lookup
`get_building_at_cell(cell)` SHALL return the building node occupying the given cell, or null if no building is on that cell. `get_all_buildings()` SHALL return the full list of placed buildings.

#### Scenario: Get building at occupied cell
- **WHEN** a building occupies cells (5,3) and (6,3)
- **THEN** `get_building_at_cell((5,3))` returns that building's node

#### Scenario: Get building at empty cell
- **WHEN** no building is at cell (0, 0)
- **THEN** `get_building_at_cell((0,0))` returns null

### Requirement: Building type catalog
On startup, BuildingManager SHALL load all buildable EntityData resources of type BUILDING into `building_types`. Only entities with `buildable == true` are included.

#### Scenario: Load building types
- **WHEN** `_ready()` runs
- **THEN** `building_types` contains all EntityData with `entity_type == BUILDING` and `buildable == true`
