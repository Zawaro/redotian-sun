# Redotian Sun — Unified Capability Matrix

Master feature reference for supporting **Tiberian Sun (TS)**, **Firestorm (FS)**,
**Red Alert 2 (RA2)**, and **Yuri's Revenge (YR)** in one data-driven, isometric-3D engine.

Companion docs:
- `docs/research/_raw/current-state-audit.md` — what the engine does today (evidence-backed)
- `docs/research/deep/README.md` — **exhaustive per-title catalogs + errata.** Feature-level
  detail and verified constants live here; read its errata before quoting any catalog number.
- `docs/research/deep/verification-{core,gameplay}.md` — adversarial conflict ledgers
- `docs/architecture/unified-engine.md` — target architecture & generic subsystems
- `docs/gap-analysis.md` — prioritized gap list with actions
- `docs/titles/*.md` — per-title quick references

> **Design-impacting facts from the deep pass (must be honored):** warhead `Verses` is editable
> in every title and the **armor enumeration is per-game** (TS 5, RA2/YR 11) — the engine must
> read a per-game armor table with variable-length `Verses`. AI script action IDs and animation
> indices also differ per title. Target YR patch **1.001**, not the 1.000 mirror.

## How to read this

**Per-title columns** mark whether the title has the feature:
`✓` present · `~` partial/variant · `–` absent · `+` added by the expansion over the base title.

**Engine status** is measured against the current Redotian Sun code (see audit):
`impl` implemented · `part` partial/schema-only · `miss` missing (no code, no spec).

**Action** is the gap type:
`DATA` per-game content only · `SYS` needs a generic engine subsystem · `SPEC` needs
documentation/spec first · `—` no action (already supported) · `FUT` future / out of scope scope.

> Rule from `AGENTS.md`: `openspec/specs/` is authoritative. This matrix is a research
> planning artifact; a `SYS`/`SPEC` action becomes real work via a future OpenSpec change.

## Legend summary

- **Already data-ready:** everything marked `impl` — the per-title work is content under
  `games/<id>/` (a new `GameDefinition` plus data sets), not engine code.
- **Generic subsystems still missing** (the bulk of new engine work, from `SYS` rows):
  superweapon/support-power framework, control-link (mind control) manager, garrison/occupancy,
  weapon state machine, ammo/reload, auto-engage/attack-move/patrol, campaign trigger/objective
  runtime, skirmish AI, navy/water, aerospace landing, save/load, status-effect/aura, crates,
  cloak/sensors, and the side→country→bonus registry.
- **Documentation gaps** (`SPEC`): theater registry semantics, editor authoring scope, and
  per-game data-set conventions for the three new titles.
