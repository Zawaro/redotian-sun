# Combat & Weapons System - Redotian Sun

## Overview
The combat system handles all damage calculation, weapon mechanics, and unit health management. This is critical for balanced gameplay and engaging tactical decisions.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Damage Types
| Type | Effective Against | Resistance Examples |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Bullet | Infantry, light vehicles | Armor reduces effectiveness |
| Explosive | Structures, armored units | Buildings take more damage |
| Energy | Vehicles, structures | Shields mitigate energy |
| Anti-Air | Aircraft only | Ground units immune |
| Siege | Buildings only | Units take reduced damage |

### 2. Weapon System Stats
- **Damage**: Base damage per shot/projectile
- **Fire Rate**: Time between shots (seconds)
- **Range**: Maximum target distance
- **Accuracy**: Probability of hitting (0.0 - 1.0)
- **Projectiles**: Number fired per volley
- **Splash Radius**: Area damage for explosives

### 3. Armor & Resistance
- Each unit has armor value reducing incoming damage
- Damage formula: `final_damage = base_damage * (1 - armor_resistance)`
- Resistances vary by damage type (e.g., tanks resist bullets)
- Overpenetration mechanics for high-damage weapons

### 4. Health Mechanics
- **Health Points**: Unit durability pool
- **Regeneration**: Passive healing over time when not in combat
- **Repair**: Active repair via engineer or self-repair ability
- **Death Effects**: Particle explosion, debris scatter, resource drop

## Technical Implementation

### Entity System Integration
Weapons are defined as `WeaponData` resources referenced by `EntityData.weapons: Array[WeaponData]` (see GitHub Issue #22):

```
WeaponData.tres (per weapon type)
    ↓ referenced by
EntityData.tres (weapons array)
    ↓ created by
EntityFactory autoload → CombatComponent
```

- **Unlimited weapons per entity** — not just primary/secondary
- Weapons stored as `Array[WeaponData]` in EntityData
- CombatComponent added when `weapons.size() > 0`
- Elite weapons stored separately in `EntityData.elite_weapons: Array[WeaponData]`

### Warhead System
Warheads define damage types and modifiers (from rules.ini [Warheads] section):

```
WarheadData extends Resource
├── id: String              # "HE", "AP", "Fire", "Sonic", etc.
├── damage_modifier: float  # multiplier vs armor types
├── cell_spread: float      # area damage spread
├── death_anim: String      # explosion animation
└── ...
```

### Armor System (Customizable)
Armor types stored in `GlobalRules.armor_types: Dictionary` — not hardcoded:

```
# From rules.ini Armor= field (string-based)
"none":    { "modifier": 1.0 }
"wood":    { "modifier": 0.7 }
"light":   { "modifier": 0.6 }
"heavy":   { "modifier": 0.4 }
"concrete":{ "modifier": 0.3 }
# Can add unlimited types: "flak", "energy", "shield", etc.
```

### Key Scripts

#### WeaponData.gd (Resource)
```gdscript
class_name WeaponData extends Resource
@export var id: String = ""
@export var damage: int = 0
@export var rate_of_fire: float = 1.0
@export var range: float = 1.0           # in cells
@export var warhead: String = "HE"
@export var projectile: String = ""
@export var fire_flh: Vector3 = Vector3.ZERO
@export var barrel_length: float = 0.0
@export var anti_air: bool = false
@export var anti_ground: bool = true
@export var splash_radius: float = 0.0
@export var ammo: int = -1               # -1 = unlimited
```

#### CombatComponent.gd (Component)
- Fire rate timer management
- Range check against target distance
- Accuracy roll for hit determination
- Spawn projectiles or apply hitscan damage directly
- Supports unlimited weapons via array iteration

#### HealthComponent.gd (EXISTING)
- Track current health/max health ratio
- Apply damage with armor calculation (from GlobalRules.armor_types)
- Trigger death when health ≤ 0
- Handle repair/regeneration over time

### Damage Calculation Logic
```gdscript
func calculate_damage(damage_type, base_damage, target_armor):
    # Get resistance values from unit stats
    var resistance = target_armor.get_resistance(damage_type)
    
    # Apply armor reduction
    var final_damage = base_damage * (1.0 - resistance)
    
    # Floor at minimum damage (1 point always gets through)
    return max(1, floor(final_damage))

func take_damage(amount, damage_type):
    current_health -= calculate_damage(damage_type, amount, armor)
    
    if current_health <= 0:
        on_unit_destroyed()
```

### Weapon Firing System
- Check range before firing
- Perform accuracy roll (random 0.0-1.0 vs weapon accuracy)
- On hit: apply damage to target's HealthComponent
- On miss: spawn impact effect at target location
- Cooldown timer prevents spamming attacks

## Integration Points
- Connect to unit system for weapon/health component attachment
- Link with pathfinding for movement while attacking
- Coordinate with selection for targeting feedback visuals
- Interface with economy for death resource refunds

## Implementation Status
- ✅ WeaponData.gd — unlimited weapons per entity via `Array[WeaponData]`
- ✅ WarheadData.gd — warhead type definitions
- ✅ GlobalRules.armor_types — customizable armor dictionary
- ✅ CombatComponent — stores weapons, turret info, threat posed
- 🔄 Remaining: Firing logic (Issue #28), damage forwarding (Issue #29), armor calculation (Issue #30)

## Future Enhancements
- Cover mechanics (units gain defense behind obstacles)
- Flanking bonuses based on attack angle
- Weapon upgrade trees per faction
- Special abilities with cooldowns and resource costs
