# Project Planning / Roadmap - RTS Edition

## Overview
This document outlines the project planning and roadmap for the Redotian Sun Tiberian Sun remake using the Redot Engine, specifically tailored for real-time strategy game mechanics.

## Current Status
- **Engine Version**: Redot 26.2 LTS
- **Project State**: Core Tiberian Sun systems complete — mission layer + multi-title expansion next
- **Last Updated**: 2026-09-14
- **Live status**: see `00-0_project_status.md` (verified breakdown) and `docs/capability-matrix.md` (feature × title × status)
- **Multi-title goal**: TS + Firestorm + RA2 + YR from one data-driven engine — `plans/12-0_unified_multi_title_expansion.md`

---

## Entity System Foundation (GitHub Issue #22)

**Status**: ✅ Implemented (architecture + core components)

The composition-based entity system is a prerequisite for most game systems. All entities (buildings, units, infantry, terrain) are created from a single `EntityData.gd` resource with dynamically added components.

**Implemented:**
- `EntityData.gd` — single resource class with ALL entity properties
- `EntityFactory.gd` — autoload that creates entities from data, adds components dynamically
- `Entity.tscn` — single base scene (empty Node3D root)
- `WeaponData.gd` — unlimited weapons per entity via `Array[WeaponData]`
- `ArtData.gd` — separate visual properties per entity, model loading via ArtComponent
- `GlobalRules.gd` — default game values from rules.ini, customizable armor types
- 7 new components: StatsComponent, FoundationComponent, PowerComponent, RadarComponent, FactoryComponent, TransportComponent, SpecialAbilityComponent
- Updated components: CombatComponent (unlimited weapons), MovementController (locomotor/movement_zone)
- ArtComponent loads models from ArtData at runtime

**Remaining work** (see GitHub Issues #23-40):
- Data population: ~30 .tres files for entities, weapons, warheads, art
- Component logic: Each component needs actual behavior (see component-specific issues)
- Integration: BuildingManager migration, GlobalRules wiring
- Validation: Component-level validation, graceful degradation

**See**: GitHub Issue #22 for full architecture details

## Next Steps

### Next Milestone: GDI Mission 01 (Reinforce Phoenix Base)
Authenticity-first milestone (GitHub milestone #1, 44 issues). Re-scoped 2026-09-14 — scripted triggers/teams/reinforcements/reveals/bridge-destruction are required; final art is a polish phase. Umbrella: #260. Full plan: `plans/13-0_gdi-mission-01_rescope.md`; status: `00-0_project_status.md`.
- **Mission systems:** #236 boot, #237 trigger engine (+#414 CellTags), #238 teams, #239 reinforcements, #240 objectives/win-lose, #415 timer, #241 camera/reveal, #248 wiring, #244 meteor, #250 bridge destruction, #255 music, #258 EVA
- **Map:** #226–#234 (importer, land-type paint, water, cliffs via #230, bridges, buildout, waypoints), #247 placement (+#412 houses, #413 roster gating)
- **Combat/defense:** #261 guard AI, #264 attack + attack-move, #245 defense weapons, #416 building upgrades
- **Pulled deps:** #203 theater, #267 aircraft, #321 impact FX, #323 AoE splash
- **Done / close:** #246 radar, #242 audio, #243 SFX. **Superseded:** #199/#207 → #230. **Descoped:** #265 superweapon targeting
- **Polish (`milestone-polish`):** #235 terrain art, #251 audio content, #252 overlay art, #253 entity art

### Priority: First Blood Goal (Issue #84)
End-to-end combat demo: deploy MCV → build base → train infantry → destroy enemy Con Yard. See `plans/10-1_first_blood_goal.md` for full breakdown.

1. ~~**Per-Player Data & Logic** (Issue #77)~~ ✅
2. ~~**MapEditor Entity Placement** (Issue #83)~~ ✅
3. ~~**MCV Deploy** (Issue #80)~~ ✅
4. ~~**Weapon Data** (Issue #23)~~ ✅
5. ~~**Prerequisite Chain** (Issue #81)~~ ✅
6. ~~**Attack Command** (Issue #79)~~ ✅
7. ~~**CombatComponent Firing** (Issue #28)~~ ✅ — hitscan MVP, fire rate timer, range check, target tracking, player-move-cancels-attack
8. ~~**Death Handling** (Issue #30/#82)~~ ✅ — death handler now frees node + unregisters cells (voice + cleanup)
9. **Projectile System** (Issue #78) + **ProjectileData Resource** (Issue #89) — future upgrade from hitscan
10. **HitboxComponent** (Issue #29) — future upgrade, needs projectile to trigger it

- **Movement**: Locomotor enforcement (#34), Terrain movement costs (#51) — mostly done
- **UI**: Infantry health bars (#39), Art damaged states (#38)

### Infrastructure
- **GlobalRules Integration** (Issue #26) — wire armor, veterancy, movement coefficients
- **BuildingManager Migration** (Issue #25) — move from BuildingType to EntityFactory
- **Debug Menu** (Issue #27) — in-game debug tools for testing
- Conduct early playtesting to validate design decisions
- Review weekly and adjust timeline based on actual development velocity
