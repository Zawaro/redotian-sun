# Final Polish & Visual Effects - Redotian Sun

## Overview
Polish and visual effects transform functional gameplay into an immersive experience. This phase focuses on animations, particle effects, sound design, and UI refinement.

## Implementation Status (verified 2026-08-08)

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| VFX (explosions/damage/construction) | ❌ | Zero particle systems; `EntityData.death_explosion_ids` / `WarheadData` VFX fields unused; death = voice + free only; buildings appear instantly (no buildup) |
| Screen shake / flash on damage | ❌ | — |
| Unit/building animations | ❌ | Only door anim wiring (`ArtComponent` on exit); no walk/attack/idle states |
| Sound design | 🟡 | `AudioManager` (4 buses) + voice hooks (select/order/fire/die) live; music 0, EVA 0, SFX content gitignored (`external_assets/`) — fresh clone is silent |
| UI/UX polish | ❌ | No tooltip system beyond cameos, no accessibility, no transitions |
| Camera easing | ❌ | Pan is raw `+= delta`; no smoothing/inertia |

**Plan-doc staleness:** the `PolishSystem`/`VFXManager`/`AnimationController`/`SoundFXPlayer` scene structure never existed. The sound-design section is superseded by the implemented `audio-system` spec (which added viewport-aware falloff).

Relevant open issues: #243 (combat SFX), #255 (music), #258 (EVA), #249 (GDI1 FX), #186 (death effects), #38 (art damaged states).

## Core Requirements

### 1. Visual Effects (VFX)
| Effect Type | Usage | Implementation |
|-------------|-------|----------------|
| Explosions | Unit/structure destruction | Particle systems with shockwave animation |
| Damage Feedback | Health reduction | Screen shake + flash overlay |
| Construction Progress | Building/unit creation | Progress bar + smoke/particle trail |
| Resource Collection | Tiberium harvesting | Sparkle effects on harvesters |
| Ability Activation | Special powers | Glow rings, energy trails |

### 2. Animation Quality Improvements
- **Unit Animations**: Walk/run/attack/idle states with smooth transitions
- **Building Animations**: Construction phases (frame-by-frame or morph)
- **Camera Movements**: Smooth easing on pan/zoom operations
- **UI Transitions**: Fade/slide effects between menu states

### 3. Sound Design Integration
| Audio Type | Purpose | Trigger Point |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| Unit Selection | Feedback for selection click | On unit select |
| Movement | Footsteps/wheel sounds | While moving |
| Combat | Weapon fire, impacts | During attacks |
| Construction | Build completion chime | When finished |
| UI Navigation | Menu hover/click sounds | All interactions |

### 4. UI/UX Polish
- **Accessibility**: Colorblind modes, scalable fonts, high contrast
- **Responsive Design**: Adapt to different screen resolutions
- **Feedback Loops**: Visual/audio confirmation for all actions
- **Tooltip System**: Context-sensitive help on hover

## Technical Implementation

### Scene Structure
```
PolishSystem.tscn (Autoload Singleton)
├── VFXManager.gd (particle system orchestration)
├── AnimationController.gd (smooth state transitions)
└── SoundFXPlayer.gd (audio trigger management)
```

### Key Scripts

#### VFXManager.gd
- Instantiate particle systems on event triggers
- Manage lifetime and cleanup of temporary effects
- Provide reusable effect presets for consistency
- Optimize draw calls via batching where possible

#### AnimationController.gd
- Interpolate between animation states using lerp
- Handle state machine transitions smoothly
- Apply easing functions for natural motion curves
- Cache animations to reduce runtime loading

### VFX Example Implementation
```gdscript
func spawn_explosion(position, radius):
    # Create particle system instance
    var explosion = preload("res://vfx/explosion.tscn").instantiate()
    explosion.position = position
    explosion.radius = radius
    
    get_tree().root.add_child(explosion)
    
    # Auto-destroy after animation completes
    explosion.connect("animation_finished", _on_explosion_complete)

func _on_explosion_complete():
    queue_free()  # Remove from scene tree

# Screen shake effect
func trigger_screen_shake(intensity, duration):
    var camera = get_camera_3d()
    camera.shake_amount = intensity
    camera.shake_duration = duration
```

### Sound System Integration
- Preload all SFX assets at startup for instant playback
- Use audio buses for volume control (master, SFX, music)
- Spatial audio for 3D positioning of unit sounds
- Dynamic mixing based on gameplay context (combat vs idle)

## Integration Points
- Connect to combat system for explosion/damage effects
- Link with animation systems for unit/building transitions
- Coordinate with audio manager for sound trigger events
- Interface with UI system for polish overlays and tooltips

## Future Enhancements
- Dynamic music system based on gameplay intensity
- Weather/environmental VFX integration (rain, snow)
- Post-processing filters (bloom, motion blur, color grading)
- Accessibility options (subtitles, visual cues for audio)
